int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions in the _printf() family produce output according to a format. It writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.

.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.BR s
If no l modifier is present: the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null bype ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written. If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.TP
.BR d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.TP
.BR %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value (-1) is returned.
